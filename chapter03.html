        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p>
            As he works through the objectives, Tommy son finds himself as one of the main targets for the cops. The races become
            more difficult, as well as ther is an increase of cops patrolling around the state. Once Tommy completes his first set
            of objectives, he calls out the #15 on the list. The meeting place and time is agreed an he makes his way to the location.
            Having arrived, Tommy senses that something does not feel right. He waits at the location for a couple of minutes
            expecting to see the #15, but the unexpected arrives - Cross among several other police men. Tommy realises that he was
            set up by someone. Cross arrests Tommy and brings him to the police station. Cross is ecstatic as he finally has enough
            proof to keep him locked up. As Tommy sits in his cell, he is called up by one of the policemen. There is someone on the
            phone for him. Once the phone is picked up, there is an evil laugh. Tommy realises that it was the racer Boss who set him
            up. Boss explains that some no-name like Tommy will not be tolerated in the scene and hangs up. Cross eventually agrees to
            cut Tommy's sentence short but with one condition, he is to be banned from America and return to Europe.
