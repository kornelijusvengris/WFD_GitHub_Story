        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p>
            The objectives are taken down one by one and soon enough Tommy calls out the first racer who occupies #15 on the list. As
            Tommy completes the last objective, 'Benno' who initially set those objectives, calls Tommy and tells him he's ready for it.
            Tommy wastes no time and finds Benno. Both racers line up to each other without saying a word and wait for the green light. The
            race begins. Tommy and Benno in close proximity throughout the race but Tommy emerges as the winner due to discovering a shortcut. Since the
            races are about 'pink slips', this means Tommy earns himself a new car. He is now officially on the Outlawz list.
            New challenges and rivals mean driving in different cities. Kelly helps out by providing Tommy with a hideout wherever he goes.
            Tommy continues to defeat each rival on the list and with that, earns money, cars and reputation.
            Eventually, he finds himself as #2 on the list meaning that the next racer who's to be called out is Boss. At this stage, Tommy
            is determined more than ever to complete the hardest objectives yet, and take revenge on the one who took his car. After multiple attempts and
            several cars seized by the cops - the challenges are completed. Tommy calls out Boss as the whole of racing scene arrive to
            spectate including Kelly. The race starts. After a very hard back and forth battle Tommy wins. However, Boss refuses to give the keys
            and attacks Kelly - who ultimately tells she is an undercover cop and arrests him. Kelly gives the keys to Tommy and tells him to run before Cross
            arrives. Having found out that Tommy had escaped, Cross chases after him. In the end, Tommy manages to escape his biggest police chase yet by
            ditching California through an underground tunnel. He is now the most wanted Racer in America.
