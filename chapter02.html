        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p>
            As Boss takes the keys from Tommy, the unexpected guests arrive - the police. Everyone scatters into all possible directions apart
            Tommy. As he lost his car, he has no way of escaping and is arrested by Sergeant 'Cross' whose aim is to end the street racing.
            In the unlikeliest of situations, Tommy is released because Sergeant does not have sufficient evidence about him.
            Kelly, one of spectators from the race picks him up from the police department and helps him by providing a garage to work on his
            cars. As they arrive into the hideout, she explains that the only way to call out a racer from the Outlawz list is to beat the
            targets set by the racer who is above in the list. Having finished explaining everything, she gives Tommy a lump of money to
            get himself a new car. Without wasting any time, Tommy gets to one of the car dealers in California and buys himself a Pontiac GTO.
            Having now acquired a car, he receives a message from Kelly with the initial tasks.
