        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p>
            As Boss takes the keys from Tommy, the unexpected guests arrive - the police. Everyone scatters into all possible directions apart
            Tommy. As he lost his car, he has no way of escaping and is arrested by Sergeant 'Cross'. In the unlikeliest of situations, Tommy
            is released because Sergeant does not have sufficient evidence about him.
