        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p>
            As Boss takes the keys from Tommy, the unexpected party guests arrive - the cops. As everyone scatters into every possible direction,
            Tommy is left stranded there. Having lost his car, he has no way of escaping and is arrested by Sergeant 'Cross' whose aim is to end the street racing scene once and for all.
            However, in the unlikeliest of situations, Tommy is released because Sergeant does not have enough evidence about him being involved in the scene.
            Kelly, who was one of spectators during the race picks him up from the police station and helps him by providing a garage to work on his
            car. Having arrived at the new hideout, she explains that the only way to call out a racer from the Outlawz list is to beat the
            targets set by that racer who is above in the list. Having finished explaining everything, she gives Tommy a lump of money to
            get himself a new car. Without any more time wasting, Tommy heads out to one of the car dealers in California and buys himself a stock Pontiac GTO.
            After modifying the car with the remaining budget, he receives a message from Kelly with the initial target. Participating in illegal races,
            destroying the town and making a bad name with the police. This is where the real journey for Tommy begins.
