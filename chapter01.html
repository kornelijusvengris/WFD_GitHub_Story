        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>
            A new kid called Tommy arrives into California's street racing world. As he arrives, he quickly realizes
            that to be the top gun here he will need to go through the famous 'Outlawz' list which contains fifteen of the
            most wanted California's racers. Having settled in a small apartment, Tommy begins to explore his new home town.
            Eventually, he finds a few guys who own a garage and agree to help him upgrade his car. While they are in the
            garage, the top 'Outlawz' racer called 'Boss' arrives. Boss quickly notices the new face and begins asking
            Tommy what is he doing in his garage. When all is said, Tommy is challenged to a 'pink slip' race. What is to
            happen next is not just an ordinary race, but a race where the loser has to give their car to the winner. As
            Tommy and Boss line up to each other, a group of spectators surround them. The race starts. Tommy leads the
            race for a about a quarter of the distance when his car's engine seizes up and loses the race and his car. He
            realizes that the Boss' buddies who were so friendly to him, tempered with his car by unscrewing the oil sump
            before the race.
