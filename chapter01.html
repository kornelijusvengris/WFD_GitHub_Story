        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>
            A kid called Tommy arrives into California's street racing world. Tommy quickly realizes
            that if he is to be the top gun here he will need to go through the famous 'Outlawz' list which contains fifteen of the
            most wanted and skilled California's racers. Having settled in a small apartment, Tommy begins to explore his new home town.
            Eventually, he finds a few guys who own a garage and agree to help him upgrade his car. While they are in the
            garage, the top 'Outlawz' racer called 'Boss' arrives. Boss quickly notices the new face and begins asking
            Tommy what is he doing in his garage. When all is said, Tommy is challenged to a 'pink slip' race. What is to
            happen next is not just an ordinary race, but a race where the loser has to give their car to the winner. As
            Tommy and Boss line up to each other, a group of spectators surround them. The race starts. Tommy leads the
            race for a about a quarter of the distance when his car's engine seizes up and loses the race and his car. After
            the race, it becomes evident that the two guys who seemed to be so friendly, were in fact Boss' buddies and that they
            were the ones who tampered with his car by unscrewing the oil sump before the race had even started.
