        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>
            A kid named Tommy arrives into California's street racing world. Tommy quickly realizes
            that if he is to become the 'top gun', he will need to rise through the famous 'Outlawz' list which contains fifteen of the
            most wanted and skilled California's racers. Having settled in a small apartment, Tommy begins to explore his new home town.
            At last, he finds a few guys who own a garage and agree to help him upgrade his car. While they are working in the
            garage, the top 'Outlawz' racer called 'Boss' arrives. Boss quickly notices the new face and begins asking
            him what he is doing in his territory. Ultimately, when all is said, Boss challenges Tommy to a 'pink slip' race. This
            is not just an ordinary race, but a race where the loser has to give their car to the winner. As Tommy and Boss line up to each other,
            a group of spectators appear to surround them. The race starts. Tommy leads the race for a about a quarter of the distance when
            suddenly his car's engine starts making strange noise and eventually seizes up losing him the race and his precious car.
            After the race, it becomes evident to him that the two guys who seemed to be so friendly, were in fact Boss' buddies who were the ones to
            tamper with his car by unscrewing the oil sump before the race had started.
